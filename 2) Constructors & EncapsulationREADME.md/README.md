# Encapsulation and Constructors in C++

This folder contains Object Oriented Programming programs written in C++ that demonstrate **encapsulation** and different types of **constructors**. These programs focus on how objects are initialised and how data is protected within a class.

The examples are designed using simple logic and real-world scenarios to strengthen conceptual understanding.

## 📌 Programs Included

| Concept | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Default Constructor | Demonstrates automatic object initialisation using a default constructor. |
| Parameterised Constructor | Shows how objects are initialised with user-defined values. |
| Constructor Overloading | Illustrates multiple constructors within the same class using different parameter lists. |
| Encapsulation | Demonstrates data hiding using private data members and public member functions. |
| Real-World Bank Example | A practical program combining encapsulation and constructors in a bank account scenario. |

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Covered

- Encapsulation  
- Data Hiding  
- Constructors  
- Default Constructor  
- Parameterised Constructor  
- Constructor Overloading  
- Object Initialisation  


## 🎯 Purpose

These programs aim to provide a clear understanding of how **constructors** help in initializing objects and how **encapsulation** ensures controlled access to class data. They serve as a foundation for advanced concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism.
