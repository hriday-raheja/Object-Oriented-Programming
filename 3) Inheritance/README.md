# Inheritance in C++

This folder contains Object Oriented Programming programs written in C++ that demonstrate different types of **inheritance**. Inheritance allows a class to acquire the properties and behaviour of another class, promoting code reusability and hierarchical relationships.

These programs are aligned with the CS305 – Object Oriented Programming & Methodology syllabus.


## 📌 Programs Included

| Type of Inheritance | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Simple Inheritance | Demonstrates inheritance between a single base class and a derived class. |
| Multilevel Inheritance | Shows inheritance across multiple levels of classes. |
| Multiple Inheritance | Demonstrates a class inheriting from more than one base class. |
| Hierarchical Inheritance | Shows multiple derived classes inheriting from a single base class. |
| Hybrid Inheritance | Demonstrates a combination of more than one type of inheritance. |



## 🧠 OOP Concepts Covered

- Inheritance  
- Base and Derived Classes  
- Code Reusability  
- IS-A Relationship  
- Access Specifiers in Inheritance  



## 🎯 Purpose

These programs help in understanding how inheritance establishes relationships between classes and enables the reuse of existing code. They form a foundation for advanced concepts, such as polymorphism and virtual functions.
