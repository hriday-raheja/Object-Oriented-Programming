# Day-5: Abstract Class & Interface (C++)

This folder contains Object Oriented Programming programs written in C++ that demonstrate the concepts of **abstract classes** and **interfaces**. These concepts help in achieving abstraction and defining contracts for derived classes.

The programs are designed as per the **CS305 – Object Oriented Programming & Methodology** syllabus.

## 📌 Programs Included

| Concept | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Abstract Class (Basic Example) | Demonstrates the use of an abstract class with pure virtual functions. |
| Abstract Class with Constructor | Shows how constructors work in abstract classes. |
| Abstract Class + Runtime Polymorphism | Demonstrates dynamic binding using abstract base class pointers. |
| Interface (Single Interface) | Demonstrates implementation of an interface using pure virtual functions. |
| Multiple Inheritance using Interface | Demonstrates multiple inheritance achieved safely using interfaces. |

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Covered

- Abstraction  
- Abstract Classes  
- Pure Virtual Functions  
- Interfaces  
- Runtime Polymorphism  
- Dynamic Binding  
- Multiple Inheritance using Interfaces

## 🎯 Purpose

These programs aim to provide a clear understanding of how **abstraction** is implemented using abstract classes and interfaces. They demonstrate how interfaces enable multiple inheritance and how abstract classes support runtime polymorphism.
