# Exception Handling in C++

This folder contains C++ programs that demonstrate **exception handling**, which is used to detect and manage runtime errors in a safe and controlled way. These examples show how programs can continue execution gracefully even when unexpected situations occur.

These programs are aligned with the **CS305 – Object Oriented Programming & Methodology** syllabus and are part of a daily practice series.
